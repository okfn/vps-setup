# vps-setup
A script to execute common setup tasks on newly created VPS (Virtual Private Servers).

## Description

This script is based on Hetzner Community guides on [How to Keep a VPS Server Safe](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/security-ubuntu-settings-firewall-tools)

This script is develop and tested in Debian 12, but probably will work on any Ubuntu as well.
